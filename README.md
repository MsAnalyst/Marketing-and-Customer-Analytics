The complete report can be read in: https://bitly.com/RFM-Report

**Business Understanding**
'Amazin', a UK-based e-commerce company, aims to develop precise marketing campaigns and optimize the
allocation of its marketing resources. However, Amazin acknowledges that its customer base exhibits diverse
needs, preferences, and shopping behaviors.

**Business Objectives** 
Customer segmentation serves as a valuable tool for businesses to tailor their strategies and tactics to
effectively target and engage their diverse customer base. 

Each customer is unique, thus Amazin is required to implement a customised approach. Focusing on the UK
market that makes up the biggest portion of the whole customers, Amazin wants to acknowledge the
high-value customers and provide invidualised marketing approaches.  

**Define the Problem**
How can Amazin proficiently divide the customer database to gain deeper insights into customer actions and execute focused marketing tactics?

**Business Questions**
What is the monthly general sales trend in the UK market?
What is the best-selling item in the UK?
How many new customers each month?
How are the RFM segmentations based on the purchasing behavior records? 
What do we do with the segmentation?  

**Modeling Task**
We are using the integrated approach to segmentation with the RFM and CLV methods. This was designed by
Sheshasaayee and Logeshwari [1]. With the first stage being the statistical approach, we will use a two-phase
approach and perform clustering in the second phase. 
After the two-phase model, we will conduct K-means clustering, followed by elbow method evaluation.
K-means clustering is a method for customer segmentation in order to assess CLV for each segment. It is one
of the well-known algorithms for clustering, originally known as Forgyâ€™s method [2], and it has been used
extensively in various fields including data mining, statistical data analysis and other business applications.
